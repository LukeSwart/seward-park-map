Its beauty is of the sort that birds like--not artificially made lawns and carefully planted flower beds--but of Nature's outlay of scraggly trees, with a generous smattering of berry bushes. ...As soon as weather conditions permit the entrance to the park will be decorated with a beautiful archway....
