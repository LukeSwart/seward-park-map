Nine decades later, the lantern stands amid Japanese maple and Pacific rhododendron; the scents of dogshit, human urine, and sun-wilted summer flowers swirl around it. The taiko-gata lantern was a gift, an oxidized plaque tells us, “symbolizing the peace and good-will that exists between Japan and the United States.” ","title":"Yokohama Taiko-Gata Lantern","credit":"Wendy Call","lat":"47.54976","long":"-122.257427","??":""},

And if you want to stop, just let go. Are you doing alright? The only adult in the group says, “I am pretty terrified.” They swing in harnesses, suspended from high vine-maple branches in their own, private rope swings. One boy hoists himself nearly to tree top, alights, and climbs around in tree-sky. “Oh, wow. How high is he up there?” He’s probably about at fifty feet. That’s like standing on top of a telephone pole. OK, kids, you’ve got fifteen minutes left. Some want to go higher, some are more than ready to return to earth. The tree-swingers have drawn a small crowd: a family of three and an older couple with matching white sun hats. A great blue egret stands pencil-slim on a South Bay piling. The boy who climbed to top-of-telephone-pole height, skims to the ground and leaps from the harness. “I had a piece of bark in my pants. How did that happen?” \nAnother boy swings fifteen feet off the ground, feet up, head down. Anybody remember what kind of tree you’re in? Only one does; the other children cheer. Two men jog by, one pushing a stroller, talking of 30K and 60K races. The climbing-swinging children are replaced by another group ready to harness up. Still, the heron waits. \n","title":"At the Vine Maples","credit":"Wendy Call","lat":"47.548802","long":"-122.256936","??":""},
