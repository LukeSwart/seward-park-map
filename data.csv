Text,,,,,,,"The beginning of a one-act play, Pinoy Hill, Seward Park, 1957, by Robert Francis Flor

Scene I (Pinoy Hill in Seward Park, Seattle. 1957. Three picnic tables placed in a row. The table at one end is marked with a RESERVED sign. A teen boy sprawls across the center table.)

MAX:  (Acts bored. Swears.) Why me? So unfair. (Pounds table.) It’s the same every year. Boring. Same old dances. Same old table. Same music. Same faces.  BORING! (Lays down on bench next to table and closes eyes.)

(An older Pinay woman (late-forties to early fifties) enters. She carries a shopping bag. Noticing him, she makes disgusting grunting and grumbling noises and mutters as she puts the bag on the table on the remaining, unreserved table.)

ROSARIO: Psst! Psst!

MAX: (Doesn’t respond. Ignores her.)

ROSARIO: Psst! Halo! Magandang umaga sa iyo! (Max continues to ignore her.)  Boy!  I said “Halo!”

MAX: I don’t understand Filipino. An’ I’m not a boy.

ROSARIO: Oh, American-born. I see.  I said “Hello. Good morning.”

MAX: (Sits up.) Can I help you?

ROSARIO: Are you saving that table?  I would like it.

MAX: (Stands)  No can do, Auntie.

ROSARIO: Ha?  Why “no can do”?  You’re the only one here. You use it just for sleep. My family is coming.

MAX: My dad would kill me if I gave up this table. I’m saving it for my family. It’s his orders.","Scene I (Pinoy Hill in Seward Park, Seattle. 1957. Three picnic tables placed in a row.

Are you doing alright? The only adult in the group says, “I am pretty terrified.” They swing in harnesses, suspended from high vine-maple branches in their own, private rope swings. One boy hoists himself nearly to tree top, alights, and climbs around in tree-sky. “Oh, wow. How high is he up there?” He’s probably about at fifty feet. That’s like standing on top of a telephone pole. OK, kids, you’ve got fifteen minutes left. Some want to go higher, some are more than ready to return to earth. The tree-swingers have drawn a small crowd: a family of three and an older couple with matching white sun hats. A great blue egret stands pencil-slim on a South Bay piling. The boy who climbed to top-of-telephone-pole height, skims to the ground and leaps from the harness. “I had a piece of bark in my pants. How did that happen?” 
Another boy swings fifteen feet off the ground, feet up, head down. Anybody remember what kind of tree you’re in? Only one does; the other children cheer. Two men jog by, one pushing a stroller, talking of 30K and 60K races. The climbing-swinging children are replaced by another group ready to harness up.
